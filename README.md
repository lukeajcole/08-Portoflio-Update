Luke Cole's Portolio Readme

[This is a website](https://lukeajcole.github.io/W2_Portfolio_LAJC/code/index.html) that has been developed by Luke Cole as part of the UCSD Extension Bootcamp for full stack web development. This is the second version my portfolio site and has been updated with real web apps that I've developed in the class. 


Here is a screenshot of the site.
